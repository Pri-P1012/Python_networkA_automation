print tn.read_all() --- tn is typically a telnetlib.Telnet object created after connecting to a Telnet server.
                        .read_all() reads all data from the Telnet connection until the connection is closed by the server.
                         It blocks (waits) until the remote side closes the connection — meaning your program will hang if the server never closes it
